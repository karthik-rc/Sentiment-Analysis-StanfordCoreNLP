## Sentiment Analysis using StanfordCoreNLP vs TextBlob vs NLTK

A short experiment to analyze the sentiment analysis capabilities of python libraries - StanfordCoreNLP, TextBlob and NLTK, done as part of an academic event at University of Minnesota - MSBA 2020 Trends Marketplace. 

##### Experiment setup and Results

This experiment considered basic off-the-shelf modules from the mentioned three libraries for comparison. After pre-processing seven ambiguous English sentences, the modules were used to determine the sentiment category of each sentence - whether it is Positive, Negative or Neutral. The sentiments determined by the modules were later compared to responses from event visitors to observe the similarity/differences in the results. 

People's opinion of sentiment of the seven sentences varied much (*as seen in Fig.1 below*) , pointing the ambiguity of the sentences chosen

Given this complexity in Natural Language Processing in terms of ambiguity, we observed the results from StanfordCoreNLP module having the highest match percent of 59% with people's responses followed by TextBlob with 41% match. 

**This indicates better performance from StanfordCoreNLP module with closest match to people's opinion being the favorable outcome.**

##### Limitation:

The comparison was made between basic off-the-shelf modules with default pre-training done from each of the libraries. The performance would vary based on the following conditions:

* Different pre-processing of input sentences
* Using a different training / pre-trained dictionary for the sentiment classification
